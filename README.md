PURPOSE: TO configure the software in C to remotely navigate the RC CAR using an Ardunino

This script uses the analogRead() and analogWrite() functions to read the values of
the remote control's joysticks and control the speed of the motors, respectively.
It also uses the digitalWrite() function to control the direction of the motors.
